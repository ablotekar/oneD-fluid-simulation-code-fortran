# 1D fluid simulation code 

The 1D fluid simulation code which can be used to study plasma waves in 
unmagnetized plasma system. The code is written in fortran and the python is
used for data visualization.

This package has four codes which are used in the study of different coherent electric field 
structures in the different plasma environment. 

The list of codes are as follows 
* **Fluid_ion_superthermal_electron**
    - In this code ion acoustic (IA) solitary wave are studied in the
    thermal, non-thermal and superthermal plasma system.
      
* **supersoliton**
     - It is used to study the evolution of the supersolitary wave 
    in the superthermal plasma system.
       
* **electron_acoustic_double_layer**
    - It is used to study the asymetric electron acoustic double layer 
    in the inner Earth magnetosphere.
      
* **two_component_full_fluid**
    - This code can be used to study the electrostatic solitary wave (ESW) in 
    two component full fluid plasma system.
    
  
More details about the code can be found in the **"README.md"** file of each
code.
