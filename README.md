# 1D fluid simulation code (fortran version)


It is fortran version of the 1D fluid simulation. This package has four 
codes which are used in the study of different coherent electric field 
structure in the different plasma environment. 

The list of codes are as follows 
* **Fluid_ion_superthermal_electron**
    - In this code ion acoustic (IA) solitary wave are studied in the
    thermal, non-thermal and superthermal plasma system.
      
* **supersoliton**
     - It is ued to study the evolution of the supersolitary wave 
    in the superthermal plasma system
       
* **electron_acoustic_double_layer**
    - It is used to study the asymetric electron acoustic double layer 
    in the inner Earth magnetosphere
      
* **two_component_full_fluid**
    - This code can be used to study the electrostatic solitary wave (ESW) in 
    two component full fluid plasma system.
      
The more details about the code can be found the **"README.md"** file of each
code
