# Two component full fluid code

This simulation code is for the plasma system which consist of fluid
ion and fluid electrons. Hence, both the plasma component are described 
by the fluid equation and coupled through the poisson's equation. 

## How to compile and run the code 

Following steps should follow to compile and execute the compile code.
* Change compile name in **makefile**. If you are using gfortran then ignore this step
* Execute **makefile** by typing
<pre><code>
make
</code></pre>

or 

<pre><code>
make -f makefile
</code></pre>

**makefile** generate executable file which name is  **"RUN*** . This name can be change
by editing **"makefile"**. 

* Execute compiled code (**"RUN"**). Run following command in terminal.  
<pre><code>
./RUN
</code></pre>


or to execute file in background do following.
<pre><code>
bash Job_submit_on_pc
</code></pre>

**"Job_submit_on_pc.sh"** is shell script which execute code in background and also 
like **"outputPC.log"** and **"errorPC.log"** to it, so any output or error generated by 
code can be seen. It also generate process id and store it into file **"process_ID.pid"**, 
which can use to kill the running code.

* Following command can be used to kill the execution of code in background 
<pre><code>
kill (process id)
</code></pre>

## Output display 

There three python scripts to display the output. 
* **"display_output.py"** show recently exported data (Phi and E)
* **"display_output_live.py"** show recently exported data and keep doing it until 
  you stop
* **"display_output_as_movie.py"** make the movie of the exported data
